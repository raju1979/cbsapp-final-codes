        <p>
            Apps that collect user or usage data must have a privacy policy and secure user consent for the collection. This includes—but
            isn’t limited to—apps that implement HealthKit or other health/medical technologies, HomeKit, Keyboard extensions,
            Apple Pay, Stickers and iMessage extensions, include a login, or access user data from the device (e.g. location,
            contacts, calendar, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>If your app doesn’t include significant account-based features, let people use it without a log-in. Apps may not
            require users to enter personal information to function, except when directly relevant to the core functionality
            of the app or required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developers that use their apps to surreptitiously discover passwords or other private data will be removed from the Developer
            Program.
        </p>
        <p>SafariViewContoller must be used to visibly present information to users; the controller may not be hidden or obscured
            by other views or layers. Additionally, an app may not use SafariViewController to track users without their
            knowledge and consent.
